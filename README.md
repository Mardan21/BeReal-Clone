## Notes

Overall the app was very fun to build. However, when I was about to upload close to midnight, my computer shutdown to due an "icu" error,
which thankfully disappeared after starting it back up. In addition, I could not get my code to properly push into the the repo I made for it. 
I was able to solve this and other issues my computer was having in about an hour and 30 minutes (so I am really hoping this will not count as a
late assignment, as I had all the logic and functionally done, and especially because I have already used up my two late assignments).
